# 01 - Movements

Just remember this words...

* `w`: word
* `b`: backwards
* `f`: forward
* `e`: end
* `H`: High
* `M`: Mid
* `L`: Low
* `y`: yank
* `p`: put
* `d`: delete

You can combine them... and use numbers to extend the expression. For example, the following actions are equivalent:

4daw (4 times delete a word) == d4w (delete 4 words)

*Tip*: to jump in to normal mode just for one action, you can use `ctrl+o`
